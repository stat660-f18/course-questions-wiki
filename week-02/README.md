[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 1]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What are the SAS names for column, row, and table?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): Column = Variable, Row = Observation/Record, and Table = Dataset.
- Question (jduan10-stat660): What's the different between observations and variables?
- Answer (jduan10-stat660): Observations are also called rows and variables are called columns.
* Question (yli110-stat660): What are the two parts of a SAS data set?
* Answer (yli110-stat660): a descriptor portion and a data portion. 
- Question (anguyen152-stat660):What are "observations" and "variables?"
- Answer (anguyen152-stat660):"Observations" can be counted as "rows" and "variables" can be counted as "columns" 
- Question (whu8-stat660): Although all kinds data can be used in SAS, only the SAS data set can be processed in SAS program?
- Answer(whu8-stat660): Yes. Although SAS supports all kinds of raw data files such as excel and etc, these raw data files need to covert to SAS data set for further analysis in SAS.



[Course Textbook Chapter 2, Problem 2]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): There are only two program steps, what are they and what color is it highlighted in SAS? And what do they do?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): The two steps are DATA and PROC.  They are both highlighted in dark blue font.  PROC step analyzes data, produces output, or manages SAS files.  The DATA step creates or modifies data.

- Answer(whu8-stat660):Yes, it's 8 bytes.



[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 5]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): How do you identify permanent dataset?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660):  If you see two-level name joined by a period, and the first word is not locwork or work, then the permanent dataset name is the second latter word of the two-level, i.e. mylib.mydata where mydata is the permanent dataset.

[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 6]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What is the default value for year cutoff and the time span?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660):  The default cutoff year is 1926, and only 100-year span is read. However, you can override the default and change the value of YEARCUTOFF= to the first year of another 100-year span. For example, if you specify YEARCUTOFF=1950, then the 100-year span is from 1950 to 2049.
- Question (jduan10-stat660): Does the value of the YEARCUTOFF= system option affect only two-digit year values?
* Question (yli110-stat660): Why do you have to specify YEARCUTOFF sometimes when interpreting two-digit year values?

[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 4]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): How and where are syntax error reported?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660):  Syntax errors are reported in the Log window displays the word “ERROR”, the line number that it occurred, and an explanation of the error.

[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 9]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): What is the best practice to end program steps?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660):  For every DATA step, there is a RUN. For every PROC step, there should be a RUN or QUIT. But you can follow another proc step without ending the previous proc step.

You should avoid placing block comment symbols in the first or second columns. While comment statements are complete statements which could start in the first or second columns, and  they can’t contain internal semicolons.



[Week 2 SAS Recipe: basic_recipe_for_loading_data_from_remote_Excel_file]
- Question (mphan12-stat660): The excel file extension is typically .xls, .xlsx, what does “?raw=true” do? 
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): Since I do not have access to the excel file, I'm assuming it means raw file format or pull from tab name “raw=FALSE”.  Here’s the documentation found on SAS site: [SAS Overview HTTP Procedure](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&cdcVersion=9.4_3.4&docsetId=proc&docsetTarget=n0t7v16eitluu2n15ffpfeafqszs.htm&locale=en).

- Question (whu8-stat660): Why do we need to clear the file ref?
- Answer(whu8-stat660): This allows sex in particular to free up the file name and the temporary storage location in order to better use resources and not create the possibility of some type of memory leak.



[Week 2 SAS Recipe: bonus_advanced_recipe_for_loading_data_from_remote_Excel_file]
- Question (mphan12-stat660):When invoking the macro %loadDataIfNotAlreadyAvailable, the semicolon is not presented, why did SAS not error out?
- Answer (mphan12-stat660): This is because the semicolon is **NOT** required for calling macros.  When you call a self contained macro, i.e. not in data or proc steps, it is fine to include the semicolon. Here is an example where the semicolon should not be added after calling the macro:
  - proc sql;
  -  select %field_list()  
  -  from sashelp.class ;  
  - quit;
- Question (jduan10-stat660): What's the use of symbol "%" in SAS?
- Answer (jduan10-stat660): This symbol is used to revoke marco command.
* Question (yli110-stat660): What's the advantage of using Macro variables in SAS?
- Question (anguyen152-stat660):Are macros in SAS of the same use as functions in C++ ? How often is macro used in SAS ?
- Question (whu8-stat660): Can a macro load sever times with different data value?
- Answer(whu8-stat660):I think the answer is yes, we can call macro as many time as we want, we could also load different values to macro variables each time we call.
